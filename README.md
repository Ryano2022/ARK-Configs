# ARK Configuration Files

These are my custom configuration files for games in the ARK series, suited to my personal playstyle. They're shared here as I've been asked for them a few times.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES ⚠️

- Mod IDs have been removed from `GameUserSettings.ini` files - **you'll need to reselect your mods** before loading your world.
- Password fields (`ServerAdminPassword`, `SpectatorPassword`, `ServerPassword`) have been left blank - add your own if needed.
